# No Politics Campaign

(Towards `notepad-plus-plus` event)

## 对于中国用户

该事件有前车之鉴，Piwiki。

事实证明，炸 issue 是个很傻的举措。issue 是个类似 bug tracker 的存在，你已经属于滥用了。

所以面对这些事件在社交媒体上反对我完全支持，但是千万不要炸 issue。这在外人看起来非常没有素质。

正确的做法：在类似 Reddit, Quora, Twitter, Facebook, Youtube 或者是国内 头条，知乎，微博 等平台发表自己的见解。

我是绝对反对这次 Don 的做法的。但是炸 issue 会更令我反感，因为这解决不了任何问题，还会败坏形象。

## To Developers of `notepad-plus-plus`

Don't relate open-source projects with politics, and you shouldn't let your users feel bad about you.

It is true you don't have to take charge of your open-source project, but when it becomes popular, you need to care about the users' feeling. Like you don't want Linus suddenly announce that Linux is abandoned.

And more, a country which makes its people live a peaceful, rich, comfortable and pleasant, no matter how it achieved this, the country is good. What you think might not be real, and the information we got are all not all real. If you want to view a thing properly, you'll need to have a good ability to identify information. You shouldn't be influenced by the analyse by others.
